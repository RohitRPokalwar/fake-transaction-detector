# 🎯 LIVE PROTOTYPE DEMO SCRIPT (Easy Mode)
*Use this script to impress your Teachers/Judges with simple, powerful language.*

---

## 🎤 Part 1: The "What is it?" (30 Seconds)
**Action:** Open the Dashboard.
**Script:** 
> "Good morning/afternoon. Today, I am showing you **VIGILO**. In simple words: it’s a digital shield that catches bank hackers and money launderers in real-time. While other systems only use old-fashioned rules, we use **Hybrid AI** that can actually 'think' and 'explain' why a transaction is fake."

## 🎭 Part 2: The "Magic" (Live Prototype Demo)
**Action:** Go to the **LIVE ANALYZER** (PhonePe-style UI).

### Scenario 1: The Teleportation Alert (Location)
**Action:** 
1. Set Sender ID to `User_Travel`.
2. Set Location to `London`.
3. Click "SECURE SCAN". (It shows SAFE).
4. **Immediately** change Location to `Mumbai`.
5. Click "SECURE SCAN" again.
**Script:** 
> "Look at this. I just sent money from London. Now, only 2 seconds later, I'm trying to send money from Mumbai. Our system triggers a **Teleportation Alert**. Why? Because humans can't travel that fast. It means someone else has hacked this account."

### Scenario 2: The Bot Burst (Speed)
**Action:**
1. Use a new User ID (e.g., `Bot_User_1`).
2. **Double-Click** the "SECURE SCAN" button very fast (Click-Click!).
**Script:** 
> "Now, watch my mouse. I’m going to pretend to be a Bot script. By clicking twice in less than 2 seconds, the system flags a **High Velocity Burst**. No human can type that fast—it's 100% a bot attack, and we stopped it instantly."

### Scenario 3: The Money Circle (Money Laundering)
**Action:**
1. Txn 1: `Alice` to `Bob` (₹50,000) -> SCAN (Safe).
2. Txn 2: `Bob` to `Charlie` (₹50,000) -> SCAN (Safe).
3. Txn 3: `Charlie` back to `Alice` (₹50,000) -> SCAN.
**Script:** 
> "Finally, the hardest fraud: **The Money Circle**. Criminals move money in circles (A to B to C back to A) to hide where it came from. Watch... as soon as the circle closes, our **Graph Engine** catches it. It doesn't just say 'Fake'—it explains that a **Money Circle** was found."

## 📊 Part 3: The "Evidence" (PDF Report)
**Action:** Go back to the main dashboard and click **"GENERATE INTELLIGENCE REPORT"**.
**Script:** 
> "Lastly, for the bank managers, we provide a one-click **Intelligence Dossier**. It strips away all the technical confusion and gives a clean 'Alert' list. It tells the manager exactly what the threat is—like 'Transaction Replay' or 'Organized Laundering'—so they can freeze the account immediately."

## 🏁 Part 4: Conclusion (15 Seconds)
**Script:** 
> "Vigilo is faster than a human and smarter than a basic rule-book. It catches 'Ghost Money', stops 'Time Travelers', and breaks 'Money Circles'. It’s the future of safe banking. Thank you!"

### 💡 Tips for "Sir/Ma'am":
1. **Show the Modal:** When a transaction is flagged, click on the **Score** or **Status** to show the **"Algorithm Transparency"** box. It looks very technical and professional.
2. **Explain Isolation Forest (if asked):** Use the "Giant in a room" story I wrote in your Documentation.
3. **Be Precise:** Always use the terms **"Ghost Money"**, **"Teleportation"**, and **"Money Circle"**—they are easy to remember and sound very impressive.
