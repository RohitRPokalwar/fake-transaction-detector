# 🎙️ TechFiesta Hackathon Presentation Script (Pitch Deck)

**Time Limit:** 5-7 Minutes
**Audience:** Technical Judges & Industry Experts

---

## ⚡ Slide 1: Title Slide
*   **Visual:** Project Name "Fake Transaction Detector" in Neon Blue, Team Name, College Logo.
*   **Audio:** "Good morning judges. We are Team [Your Team Name], and we are here to solve one of the biggest challenges in the modern fintech world: **Invisible Fraud**."

---

## 🛑 Slide 2: The Problem (The "Why")
*   **Visual:** Headlines of recent UPI scams, a graph showing rising fraud cases.
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Digital transactions are exploding (UPI, NetBanking).
    *   Fraudsters are smarter: Money Laundering rings, sleeper accounts.
    *   Current Rule-Based systems are *reactive* (too late) 
*   **Audio:** "While digital India grows, so does digital crime. Traditional rule engines only catch what they know. AI can catch new patterns, but it can't explain *why* it flagged a user, making it useless for legal action. We need a system that is both **Adaptive** and **Explainable**."

---

## 💡 Slide 3: Our Solution (The "What")
*   **Visual:** High-level concept. "Rules + AI + Graph = The Ultimate Shield".
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   **Hybrid Intelligence:** We don't rely on just one method.
    *   **Glass-Box AI:** We explain every decision.
    *   **Real-Time Dashboard:** For immediate action.
*   **Audio:** "Introducing the **Fake Transaction Detector**. It's a unified intelligence platform that combines strict rules, behavioral ML, and graph network analysis into a single decision engine. Most importantly, it speaks human language—telling you exactly why a transaction is suspicious."

---

## 🏗️ Slide 4: System Architecture (The "How")
*   *(Show the Architecture Diagram here)*
*   **Audio:** "Our architecture works in three layers.
    1.  **Ingestion:** Data comes in via CSV or API.
    2.  **The Triple-Engine Core:**
        *   **DDIE** handles data integrity.
        *   **UAIC** (User Anomaly Intelligence) learns user habits using Isolation Forests.
        *   **Graph Engine** detects money loops (Simulated Money Laundering).
    3.  **Hybrid Scorer:** Averages these insights to give a final confidence score."

## 🚀 Slide 5: Key Innovation - 'Graph & Explainability'
*   **Visual:** Screenshot of the dashboard showing a 'Reason' text and a circular graph.
*   **Audio:** "Our USP is **Context**. If User A sends money to User B, who sends it back to A in 5 minutes—that's a rule loop. Our Graph engine catches this instantly. And using SHAP values, we generate explanations like 'Unusual Time of Day' or 'Amount exceeds 3-month average'."

## 🔮 Slide 7: Business Impact & Future Scope
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   **Impact:** Reduced false positives, faster investigation time.
    *   **Future:** Real-time UPI blocking API, Blockchain evidence locker.
*   **Audio:** "This tool isn't just a prototype; it's a foundation for a secure financial ecosystem. We plan to add blockchain logging for immutable evidence and direct UPI API hooks."
